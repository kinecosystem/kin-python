# Deprecation Warning

Kins's Agora powered SDKs have been deprecated and Agora replaced with Kinetic.

## Kinetic

Kinetic is an open-source suite of tools that make it easy to build apps that integrate Solana.

It provides a consistent and clean abstraction over the Solana SDKs and enhances it with some commonly requested features like paying Solana fees on behalf of the user, tracking and timing the users transactions and sending out webhooks.

Kinetic is aimed at developers that want to build crypto-experiences for the users of their app, hiding a lot of the details about the blockchain out of sight for both the developer and the end user.

Learn more about Kinetic [here](https://developer.kin.org/docs/kinetic).

See our new suite of Kinetic SDK's [here](https://developer.kin.org/docs/developers).

# Kin Python SDK

The Kin Python SDK enables developers use Kin inside their backend servers. It contains support for blockchain actions 
such as creating accounts and sending payments, as well a webhook handler class to assist with implementing Agora webhooks. 

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation
```
pip install kin-sdk-v2
```

## Overview
The SDK contains two main components: the `Client` and the `WebhookHandler`. The `Client` is used for blockchain
actions, such as creating accounts sending payments, while the `WebhookHandler` is meant for developers who wish to make
use of Agora Webhooks. It is recommended that developers read the [website documentation](https://docs.kin.org) prior to using this SDK.



## Client
The main component of this library is the `Client` class, which facilitates access to the Kin blockchain. 

### Initialization
At a minimum, the client needs to be instantiated with an `Environment`.

```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment 

client = Client(Environment.TEST)
```

Apps with [registered](https://docs.kin.org/app-registration) app indexes should initialize the client with their index:
```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)
```

### Usage

The following outlines some example usages of the client. See the [documentation](https://docs.kin.org/python/api) for more details.
 
#### Create an Account
The `create_account` method creates an account with the provided private key.

To create a new account, first generate a new private key, then submit it using `create_account`:
```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment
from agora.keys import PrivateKey

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)

private_key = PrivateKey.random()
client.create_account(private_key)
```

#### Get a Transaction
The `get_transaction` method gets transaction data by transaction id.
```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)

# tx_id is either a 32-byte Stellar transaction hash or a 64-byte Solana transaction signature 
tx_id = b'<txid>'
transaction_data = client.get_transaction(tx_id)
```

#### Get an Account Balance
The `get_balance` method gets the balance of the provided account, in [quarks](https://docs.kin.org/terms-and-concepts#quark).
```python
from agora.keys import PrivateKey
from agora.client import Client, Environment

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)
public_key = PrivateKey.random().public_key
balance = client.get_balance(public_key)
``` 

#### Submit a Payment
The `submit_payment` method submits the provided payment to Agora.
```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment
from agora.keys import PrivateKey, PublicKey
from agora.model import Payment, TransactionType
from agora.utils import kin_to_quarks

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)
sender = PrivateKey.from_string('SXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
dest = PublicKey.from_string('GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
payment = Payment(sender, dest, TransactionType.EARN, kin_to_quarks("1"))

tx_hash = client.submit_payment(payment)
```

#### Submit an Earn Batch
The `submit_earn_batch` method submits a batch of earns to Agora from a single account. It batches the earns into fewer 
transactions where possible and submits as many transactions as necessary to submit all the earns.
```python
from agora.client import Client, Environment
from agora.keys import PublicKey, PrivateKey
from agora.model import Earn, EarnBatch
from agora.utils import kin_to_quarks

client = Client(Environment.TEST, app_index=1)
sender = PrivateKey.from_string('SXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')
dest1 = PublicKey.from_string('GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX1')
dest2 = PublicKey.from_string('GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX2')

# Send two earns of 1 Kin each
earns = [
    Earn(dest1, kin_to_quarks("1")),
    Earn(dest2, 100000),  # also equivalent to 1 Kin
    ...
]
batch = EarnBatch(sender, earns)

batch_earn_result = client.submit_earn_batch(batch)
```

### Examples
A few examples for creating an account and different ways of submitting payments and batched earns can be found in `examples/client`.

## Webhook Handler
The `WebhookHandler` class is designed to assist developers with implementing the [Agora webhooks](https://docs.kin.org/how-it-works#webhooks). 

Only apps that have been assigned an [app index](https://docs.kin.org/app-registration) can make use of Agora webhooks.   

### Initialization
The `WebhookHandler` must be instantiated with the app's configured [webhook secret](https://docs.kin.org/agora/webhook#authentication).
```python
from agora.client import Environment
from agora.webhook.handler import WebhookHandler

webhook_handler = WebhookHandler(Environment.TEST, 'mysecret')
```  

### Usage
Currently, `WebhookHandler` contains support for the following webhooks:
- [Events](https://docs.kin.org/how-it-works#events), with `handle_events`
- [Sign Transaction](https://docs.kin.org/how-it-works#sign-transaction), with `handle_sign_transaction`

#### Events Webhook
To use the `WebhookHandler` with the Events webhook, developers should define a function that accepts a list of events and processes them in some way:
```python
from typing import List

from agora.webhook.events import Event


def process_events(events: List[Event]) -> None:
    # some processing logic
    return
``` 

This function can be used with `WebhookHandler.handle_events` inside your events endpoint logic as follows:
```python
from typing import List

from agora.client import Environment
from agora.webhook import WebhookHandler, AGORA_HMAC_HEADER
from agora.webhook.events import Event

webhook_handler = WebhookHandler(Environment.TEST, 'mysecret')


def process_events(events: List[Event]) -> None:
    # some processing logic
    return


# This will vary depending on which framework is used.
def events_endpoint_func(request):
    status_code, request_body = webhook_handler.handle_events(
        process_events,
        request.headers.get(AGORA_HMAC_HEADER),
        request.body,
    )
    
    # respond using provided status_code and request_body  
```

#### Sign Transaction Webhook 
The sign transaction webhook is used to sign Kin 3 transactions with a whitelisted Kin 3 account to remove fees. On Kin 4, the webhook can be used to simply approve or reject transactions submitted by mobile clients. 

To use the `WebhookHandler` with the Sign Transaction webhook, developers should define a function that accepts a sign transaction request and response object and verifies the request in some way and modifies the response object as needed:
```python
from agora.webhook.sign_transaction import SignTransactionRequest, SignTransactionResponse

def verify_request(req: SignTransactionRequest, resp: SignTransactionResponse) -> None:
    # verify the transaction inside `req`, and modify `resp` as needed.
    return
```

This function can be used with `WebhookHandler.sign_transaction` inside your sign transaction endpoint logic as follows:
```python
from agora.client import Environment
from agora.webhook import WebhookHandler, AGORA_HMAC_HEADER
from agora.webhook.sign_transaction import SignTransactionRequest, SignTransactionResponse

webhook_handler = WebhookHandler(Environment.TEST, 'mysecret')

def verify_request(req: SignTransactionRequest, resp: SignTransactionResponse) -> None:
    # verify the transaction inside `req`, and modify `resp` as needed (e.g. by calling `sign`).
    return

# This will vary depending on which framework is used.
def sign_tx_endpoint_func(request):
    status_code, request_body = webhook_handler.handle_sign_transaction(
        verify_request,
        request.headers.get(AGORA_HMAC_HEADER),
        request.body,
    )
    
    # respond using provided status_code and request_body  
```

### Example Code
A simple example Flask server implementing both the Events and Sign Transaction webhooks can be found in `examples/webhook/app.py`. To run it, first install all required dependencies (it is recommended that you use a virtual environment):
```
make deps
make deps-dev
```

Next, run it as follows from the root directory (it will run on port 8080):
```
export WEBHOOK_SECRET=yoursecrethere
export WEBHOOK_SEED=SXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

python -m examples.webhook.app
```
